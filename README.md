# osu-patcher (WIP)

Enable several features that peppy goddamn disabled while playing with the Relax mod.
This is for use on <ins>private servers **only**</ins> that allow patchers. (Such as Akatsuki, probably)

## Usage

soon™️ once I get actions working

## Compiling

I dunno how to compile properly just use Rider/Visual Studio whatever I'm barely
a C# dev. Compile/run the `osu-patcher` project.
